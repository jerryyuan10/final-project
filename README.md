## SVOA Game Introduction

This final project called [SVOA - Game](https://svoa-game-final-project.vercel.app/).

### Motivation for the app

I take this project idea from a physical kids game ‚ÄúSubject Verb Object
Adverbial Phrase (SVOA) sentences‚Äù for english learning.<br />

In this game,the player has a set of subjects they can choose, like The man, The dad, The dog, The car, etc. As well as sets of verbs, objects and adverbs to choose.<br />
When the player conjunct those together in a sentence, it sometimes doesn‚Äôt make sense and is pretty funny to read.<br />

I hope people can enjoy playing this game, not only the kids.

### Here's the list of features:

- Player is able to choose the subject, verb, object, and adverbial from the list I predetermined for them.
- Player is able to submit the choices and see the final conjuncte sentence.
- At home page, player can click the button to play a mini game that random the word "SVOA".

### Current status of the app

The project is finished.<br />
However, I'm still working on how to end the question page without crash. üòÇ
